# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications to solve real-world problems. Key aspects of software engineering include:
Modularity: Breaking software into smaller, reusable components that can be developed and tested independently
Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality to other parts of the software
Encapsulation: Wrapping data and functions into single units and protecting internal state from external modification

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Traditional Programming: Primarily focuses on writing code to solve a specific problem. The programmer's scope is limited to the code itself, while Software Engineering encompasses the entire software development life cycle, from design to deployment, and involves a broader range of responsibilities

Traditional programming requires a strong understanding of algorithms, data structures, and programming languages. The programmer's focus is on writing efficient and clean code while software Engineering is not  concerned with  programming skills, software engineers need to have a deep understanding of software design, architecture, testing, and project management
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): 
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a structured process used by the software industry to design, develop, test, and maintain high-quality software.
Planning and Requirement Analysis:
This stage involves planning the project, gathering requirements from customers, sales departments, market surveys, and domain experts. It includes identifying risks and defining the technical approaches to implement the project successfully.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Unit testing is a software testing method where individual components of the software are tested independently to verify each part functions correctly. 

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
